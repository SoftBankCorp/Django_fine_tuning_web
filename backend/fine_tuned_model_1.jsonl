{"prompt": "What has been the FOMC's recent approach to monetary policy in response to high inflation?\n", "completion": "In response to high inflation, the FOMC has significantly tightened monetary policy. They have increased the policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have reduced their securities holdings at a brisk pace. Despite these changes, the full effects of the tightening have yet to be felt.\n"}
{"prompt": "What are the recent developments in the U.S. economy and labor market, as noted by Chair Powell?\n", "completion": "According to Chair Powell, the U.S. economy has been growing at a modest pace, with consumer spending improving but activity in the housing sector remaining weak, largely due to higher mortgage rates. The labor market is very tight, with robust average payroll job gains of 283 thousand per month. While the unemployment rate has slightly increased, it remains low, and there are signs of better balance between supply and demand in the labor market.\n"}
{"prompt": "How does the FOMC view the current state of inflation and its future trajectory?\n", "completion": "The FOMC notes that inflation remains significantly above their 2 percent long-term goal. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 4.4 percent, and core PCE prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 4.7 percent. While inflation has moderated somewhat since mid-last year, inflation pressures remain high. The median projection in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is for total PCE inflation to be 3.2 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year, with inflation expected to return to the 2 percent goal by 2025.\n"}
{"prompt": "What is the FOMC's policy stance considering the current state of the economy and inflation?\n", "completion": "Considering the headwinds from tighter credit conditions, the uncertain lag with which monetary policy affects the economy, and the extent to which policy has already been tightened, the FOMC has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate and continue reducing securities holdings. However, further rate increases are likely towards the end of the year. The FOMC will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments in deciding the extent of any further policy tightening.\n"}
